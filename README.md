# QuickFS API Tool
_QuickFS Financial Statement Tool In Pandas DataFrame Output_

Boyko Wealth utilizes the QuickFS API for financial data models on over 41,000 companies. This tool was created to generate Financial Statement parquet "databases" for advanced screening or analysis.

## How It Works
The project utilizes the QuickFS API to batch request data for each company. The main.py file allows for the generation of annual and quarterly financial databases for a list of close to 40,000 companies in North America, Europe, and Australia. Running main.py requires an active QuickFS API Key, which can be found at https://quickfs.net/

## Boyko Wealth Use Case
Boyko Wealth utilizes QuickFS data in our comprehensive equity models. The databases are updated regularly to ensure up-to-date information is always available. We have chosen QuickFS as our data provider due to their flexibility in server capacity and high quality data.
